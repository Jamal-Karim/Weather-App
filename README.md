# Weather-App
Weather app that fetches data from https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/ Api. The project uses webpack for bundling as well as ES6 module usage for cleaner code and more modularity. The website outputs various weather stats such as the basic current stats of the time, forecasted temps for the next 3 hours, as well as a farenheit to celsius temperature converter.
